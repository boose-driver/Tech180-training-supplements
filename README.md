# Tech180-training-supplements
Don't forget to take your supplements!
This repository is currently made as a supplement to the trainings that you are currently receiving from higher ups that aren't Mike (no beard), David (only one), and Maks (occasional beard).
Right now, it is a lot of documents but we hope to eventually have better organized documents, slides, and even videos to help you along.
Please make sure to ask us any questions and don't be too shy to ask as the only way to learn fast is to fail fast and ask faster.
We're all just doing our best. 
Except for Maks.
